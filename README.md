Wii U Splash Assist
This is a work in progress. Basically it takes a 1280x720 tga and a 48khz
stereo wav file and inserts them into Root.rpx. The file then needs to be
copied via an ftp client to the Wii U system. The system must have either
ISFSHAX or DeFuse installed for it to work.

After all is done, when you boot the system the initial splash screen and
sound will be changed to the selected image + wav inserted into root.rpx.

Use at your own risk!
