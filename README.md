Wii U Splash Assist is a work in progress. Basically it takes a 1280x720 tga and a 48khz
stereo wav file and inserts them into Root.rpx. The file then needs to be
copied via an ftp client to the Wii U system. I strongly suggest the included .tga image
in the release be used as a template, just paste your image over the template in Gimp
and export/overwrite it. I also included a .png that matches the included .tga to match
the splash image if you're booting to Aroma. I'm currently making a video tutorial which
I'll link to here. The system must have either ISFSHAX or DeFuse installed for it to work.

After all is done, when you boot the system the initial splash screen and
sound will be changed to the selected image + wav inserted into root.rpx.

Use at your own risk!
